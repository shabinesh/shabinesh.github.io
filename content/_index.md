Hello there, I'm Sab, a software engineer with over 14 years of experience building and leading teams. I am passionate about using technology to better enable people. 

Recently sustainable clothing has caught my attention (Yep, I am that guy now), and building small projects for fun (and secretly hoping to hit the jackpot, you know the SaaS lottery)

In my personal life, I am a father, learning to be better at it. And I play chess, still learning the ropes.
