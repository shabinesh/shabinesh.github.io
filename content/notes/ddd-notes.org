* Aggregate and Aggregate root

  Aggregates are cluster of entities and values objects and define
  boudaries around each. Goal of aggregate is to protect the
  invariants and guarantee consistency.

  The size of the aggregate has an impact. Big aggregate will have
  issues guaranteeing consistency and forcing transactions on the
  whole aggregate may cause scalibility issues.

  Aggregate roots is the entry point for the aggregate. The root
  entity enforces invariants true and keeps the aggregate consistent,
  however, root can delegate other objects within the aggregate to
  ensure consistency.

  If we find us trying to guarantee transactions between
  aggregates, then it is a sign that some invariants are not thought
  out carefully.

  Aggregate should be cohesive and not split between nodes.
