Bounded Context Its a subdomain. Ubiquitous language are within bounded context.
There are Polysemes, same word could can mean different things between contexts.
And shared language between contexts. For example: &#34;Product&#34;.
Aggregate and Aggregate root Aggregates are cluster of entities and values objects and define boundaries around each. Goal of aggregate is to protect the invariants and guarantee consistency.
The size of the aggregate has an impact. Big aggregate will have issues guaranteeing consistency and forcing transactions on the whole aggregate may cause scalibility issues."><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:title" content="DDD Notes"><meta property="og:description" content="(in progress)
