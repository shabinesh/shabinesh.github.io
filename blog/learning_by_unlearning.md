In my view, learning should be liberating, not binding.

We live in a time of overwhelming abundance. Information is everywhere—more than we could ever consume—and certainly far more than we absorbed a decade ago. Yet, much of it is irrelevant to our everyday lives. This raises an uncomfortable question: has this constant stream of knowledge made us more creative, more intelligent?

Perhaps not. If consuming and processing vast amounts of information were the measure of intelligence, then large language models already outperform human minds.

The truth is, information overload doesn’t always sharpen us—it often clouds us. Our thoughts get tangled in emotions triggered by external sentiments, our clarity muffled by biases and preconceptions shaped by endless digital consumption and societal expectations. True clarity comes only in stillness, not in noise.

A curious and creative mind cannot thrive when it is perpetually busy. Paradoxically, we must allow ourselves to be bored. To truly understand the sea, it’s better to dive in than to endlessly read about it. Learning is not only about doing—it is about being available, throwing oneself fully into the moment. That is where joy and freedom lie.

Real learning is about removing the bindings, not adding more. Sometimes the path to clarity—in our work, in our families, and in life itself—comes not from adding more information, but from removing one thing at a time until the light breaks through.
