Ubiquitous language are within bounded context. For
example, a person might be called a "Lead" in the marketing context,
"Customer" is Order context, "Subscriber" in subscription context.</p><p>There are [Polysemes](<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysemy),>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysemy),</a> same

boundaries around each. Goal of aggregate is to protect the
invariants and guarantee consistency.</p><p>The size of the aggregate has an impact. Big aggregate will have
issues guaranteeing consistency and forcing transactions on the
whole aggregate may cause scalibility issues.</p><p>Aggregate roots is the entry point for the aggregate. The root
entity enforces invariants true and keeps the aggregate consistent,
however, root can delegate other objects within the aggregate to
ensure consistency.</p><p>If we find us trying to guarantee transactions between
aggregates, then it is a sign that some invariants are not thought
out carefully.</p><p>Aggregate should be cohesive and not split between nodes.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-3>Domain Services</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-2><p>Operations which are external to aggregate and represents a domain
concept could be encapsulated into domain service. Domain services
are part of domain model and stateless.</p><div class="src src-:name"><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-:name data-lang=:name>fn GetCurrentISOWeek() { ... }

fn CalculateTax(price Money) { ... }</code></pre></div><p>In the preceding example, service involving clock could become a
domain service. This is useful for testing, by patching (monkey
patching/mocking) using the programming language tools.</p></div></div></article></main></body></html>
