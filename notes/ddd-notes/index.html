boudaries around each. Goal of aggregate is to protect the
invariants and guarantee consistency.</p><p>The size of the aggregate has an impact. Big aggregate will have
issues guaranteeing consistency and forcing transactions on the
whole aggregate may cause scalibility issues.</p><p>Aggregate roots is the entry point for the aggregate. The root
entity enforces invariants true and keeps the aggregate consistent,
however, root can delegate other objects within the aggregate to
ensure consistency.</p><p>If we find us trying to guarantee transactions between
aggregates, then it is a sign that some invariants are not thought
out carefully.</p><p>Aggregate should be cohesive and not split between nodes.</p></div></div></article></main></body></html>
