classes.</p><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-2>Single Responsibility Principle</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-3><p>SRP states there should be one reason for a module to
change. Stakeholders are usually the reason to changes. The principle
is voilated if change in one module affects code other stakeholders
depend upon.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-3>Open Closed Principle</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-3><p>The core of a good software is any extension should only cause small
changes. This could be acheived by organizing the dependencies and
ensuring changes to one component does not affect others.</p><p>The dependencies are unidirectional creating a notion of layers or
levels. Modules at the higher level are protected from changes
introduced at the lower level.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-4 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-4>Liskov Substituion Principle</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-3><p>A program's behaviour is unchanged when an object of type T is
replaced with object of type S, where S is a subtype of T.
Voilations:</p><ol><li>A duck is replaced by a rubber duck.</li><li>A rectangle is replaced with square. Calculation of square of

`Employee` depends on a framework F, F in turn depends on X. Some
feature of the X is not used. If the unused feature breaks which would
inturn break F and Employee.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-6 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-6>Dependency Inversion Principle</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-6 class=outline-text-3><p>Fleixble system should depend on abstraction instead of
concretion. But dependeing upon concrete dependencies are
inevitable. For example, the OS is usually a stable dependency. We are
